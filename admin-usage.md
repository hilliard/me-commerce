# Admin System - Complete Flow Guide

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Step 1: Login as Admin

- Navigate to http://localhost:5600
- Click "Log in"
- Enter credentials (the form uses **email**, not a username):
  - **Email**: `admin@me-commerce.local` (run `npm run admin:seed` in the `server` folder if that user is missing)
  - **Password**: `test1234` (dev login bypass in `server/src/routes/auth.ts`; not the same string as the hash stored by `admin:seed`)

### Step 2: See Admin Features Appear

After login, you'll notice:

1. ✅ "Admin Panel" link appears in top navigation (in red)
2. ✅ "Manage Songs" button becomes visible
3. ✅ "Manage Products" button becomes visible
4. ✅ "+ Add Product" button becomes visible

### Step 3: Access Admin Dashboard

1. Click "Admin Panel" link in navigation menu
2. You'll see the admin dashboard with:
   - List of all users
   - Search box to find users
   - Edit buttons for each user

### Step 4: Manage Users

1. Click "Edit" on any user to open their detail modal
2. In the modal, you can:
   - **Edit User Info**:
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Email (creates history record)
     - Phone Number
     - Active/Inactive status
   - **Manage Roles**:
     - View current roles (shown as badges)
     - Add new roles from dropdown
     - Remove roles by clicking the × on each role

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Permission System

The admin system uses `users.manage` permission which is:

- ✅ Granted to: `admin` role only
- ✅ Required for: All admin endpoints
- ✅ Checked by: `requirePermission('users.manage')` middleware

### Protected Endpoints

All these endpoints require admin role:

```
GET /api/admin/users
GET /api/admin/users/:humanId
PUT /api/admin/users/:humanId
PUT /api/admin/users/:humanId/email
POST /api/admin/users/:humanId/roles
DELETE /api/admin/users/:humanId/roles
GET /api/admin/roles
```

### UI Visibility

These elements are hidden for non-admin users:

- Admin Panel navigation link
- "+ Add Product" button
- "Manage Products" button
- "Manage Songs" button

## 📊 Data Structure

## 🔄 User Management Workflow

### Creating a New User

1. User signs up from signup page
2. System creates:
   - `humans` record (first/last name)
   - `customers` record (username/password)
   - `email_history` record (current email)
   - Assigns `customer` role

### Admin Modifying a User

1. Admin clicks "Edit" on user
2. Admin can change:
   - Name → Updates `humans` table
   - Email → Creates new `email_history` record, marks old as inactive
   - Phone → Updates `humans` table
   - Active Status → Updates `humans` table

### Admin Assigning a Role

1. Admin selects role from dropdown
2. System inserts into `human_site_roles`
3. Role becomes immediately active
4. User's permissions update on next login

### Admin Revoking a Role

1. Admin clicks × next to role name
2. System deletes from `human_site_roles`
3. Role revoked immediately
4. User's permissions update on next login

## 📋 Example Workflows

### Scenario 1: Promote Customer to Admin

1. Log in as admin (`admin@me-commerce.local` / `test1234`)
2. Go to Admin Panel
3. Search for user by name
4. Click "Edit"
5. Under "Roles" section:
   - Click dropdown (currently shows available roles)
   - Select "admin"
   - Click "Add"
6. User gets admin role
7. On next login, user will see "Admin Panel" link

### Scenario 2: Change User Email

1. Open user detail modal
2. Update email address in "Email" field
3. Click "Update User"
4. System creates new email_history record
5. Old email marked as inactive
6. New email now associated with user

### Scenario 3: Disable User Account

1. Open user detail modal
2. Uncheck "Active" checkbox
3. Click "Update User"
4. User marked as inactive in database
5. User cannot log in

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test Admin Role Assignment

```bash
node test-admin.js
```

This script:

- Finds the seeded admin human (by email in your DB)
- Checks current roles
- Assigns admin role if not already assigned
- Verifies the assignment
- Confirms all API endpoints are ready

### Manual API Testing

```bash
# Get all users (requires admin session)
curl -X GET http://localhost:5600/api/admin/users

# Get specific user details
curl -X GET http://localhost:5600/api/admin/users/1

# Get available roles
curl -X GET http://localhost:5600/api/admin/roles

# Update user (requires admin permission)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5600/api/admin/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"New","lastName":"Name"}'
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Email History**: When admin changes email, old email is preserved in history
2. **Role Expiration**: Roles can have expiration dates (optional feature)
3. **Session Management**: Changes don't affect current session, user needs to re-login to see new permissions
4. **Active Status**: Disabling user doesn't log them out, but prevents new logins
5. **Connection Management**: All database operations use try/finally to prevent connection leaks

## 🚀 Production Deployment Considerations

1. **Session Secret**: Change `SPIRAL_SESSION_SECRET` env var

4. **Audit Logging**: Consider logging all admin actions
5. **Backups**: Regular database backups for admin changes
